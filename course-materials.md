## A Comment on Assigned Quantitative Methods Books and Graduate-Level Methods Instruction

The decision on required books are made months in advance of the actual semester. I have the following two-pronged perspective to graduate-level methods instruction. One, the student should read and read widely. Two, no one reading will be sufficient to learn quantitative methods and students will need a bricolage approach to make sense of the material. The assigned books generally serve two purposes. Kellstedt and Whitten (2013) is a gentler text, aimed more at communicating the underlying concepts. Gujarati (2014) will be more about implementation.

I want to add a few *recommended* books the students may find useful, at least because I found them incredibly useful myself. I highly recommend [the Gelman and Hill (2007) book](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Analytical/dp/B00QAV71GO) in particular. I owe much to this book (and my own stubborn persistence in teaching myself quantitative methods) even if much of the implementation they offer looks dated relative to recent advances in `R` (see also: [Gelman et al., 2020](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/regression-and-other-stories/DD20DD6C9057118581076E54E40C372C)). I also strongly recommend reading the [Ziliak and McCloskey (2008)](https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Statistical-Significance-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472050079) book to better appreciate what quantitative methods cannot tell us and how easy it is to misinterpret what these methods are doing for us as researchers. Interested students should first look at these books at the library or on Google Preview and decide if they'd like to learn from these. I have e-versions of almost all these books that I can share as well.
