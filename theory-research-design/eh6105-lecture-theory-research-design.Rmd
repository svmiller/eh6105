# Introduction
### Goal(s) for Today

1. Introduce students to the research process that separates science from non-science.
2. Emphasize some key components to a quantitative research design.

# Research as Process
### Research as Process

Scientific research is a process that entails the following.

1. Developing an empirically answerable question.
2. Deriving a falsifiable hypothesis from a theory purported to answer the question.
3. Gathering/analyzing data to test the hypothesis.
4. Rejecting or failing to reject the hypothesis.
5. Relating results to theory from which the question was drawn.

## Stages of Research
### Stages of Research

0. Perspective
1. Causal theory
2. Hypothesis
3. Empirical test
4. Evaluation of hypothesis
5. Evaluation of causal theory
6. Advance in scientific knowledge

### Perspective Matters

A perspective is a general orientation to the world. They're untestable because:

1. They're too broad. Empirical support will never be total.
2. Perspectives are slippery and contextual.
	- e.g. "People are rational."
3. Any empirical data observed can be interpreted to fit the perspective.

We start with perspectives because we're not blank slates.

<!-- - Rationality, for example, informs our general theories and the data-collection process. -->

### What is a Theory?

Theories follow perspectives.

- They're systematic purported explanations of how the "world" (or part of it that interests the researcher) operates.

Theories are too abstract to be tested.

- However, they lend themselves to operationalizations of the theory's concepts.
- We end up testing the theory's predictions (or hypotheses).

### Hypotheses
	
Hypotheses are the *falsifiable* statements.

- i.e. they are able to be "proven wrong".
- They also entail a means of operationalization (i.e. variables).
	
### Knowledge Accumulation

Results from empirical tests add to (or even refute) standing scientific knowledge.

- Copernicus: *On Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*.
- Lazersfeld et al. (1944): *The People's Choice*.

Empirical tests can culminate in **paradigm shifts**, leading to new research agendas.

<!-- - The "first principle of wing-walking" is a metaphor for when we should jettison research paradigms in favor of new ones. -->
	
### Summary of the Research Process

There are different norms across different social sciences.

<!-- - Sociology may have a bigger emphasis on grand theorizing. -->
- Political science is mostly "mid-range", focusing on strategic constraints and instrumental rationality.
- Even within IR, you can still get a heavy dose of grand theorizing if you want it.


	
Perhaps political science looks more like: puzzle -> research question -> theory -> hypotheses -> analysis.

## The Relationship between Research and Proof
### Research Does Not Prove

The research process is (mostly) a deductive exercise.

- Each stage is a consequence of the previous stage *except* for the analysis phase.
- Therein, results are compared "up" to the hypothesis to check for consistency.

As a result, we can't prove theories true.

- At the most, we say our findings are consistent with the theory.

### Affirming the Consequent

Generally, our hypotheses look like forms of an argument or syllogism.

- If my theory is valid (A), my predictions about the data will be correct (B).
- If we observe B, we cannot prove A.

### Affirming the Consequent

Take a simple logical example: if Zlatan Ibrahimović wins the lottery (A), he will be rich (B).

- The Zlatan is rich (B).
- Therefore, The Zlatan won the lottery (A).

We know this is not true.

- i.e. The Zlatan is rich for he is The Zlatan.

### Denying the Consequent

Research can't prove a theory true, but it can disprove one.

- i.e. if A, then B. Not-B. Therefore, Not-A.

Take a simple logical example.

- If I get thrown off the Eiffel Tower (A), I will die (B).
- I am not dead (~B).
- Therefore I've not been thrown off the Eiffel Tower (yet) (~A).

If the data don't support the hypothesis, you can reject all or part of the theory.

### Hypothetico-Deductivism (H-D), in a Nutshell

You may see this kind of process called "hypothetico-deductivism" (e.g. Hausman, 1990).

1. Formulate some hypothesis *H* from theory *T*.
2. Deduce prediction *P* from *H* with necessary qualifiers (e.g. “ceteris paribus”).
3. Test *P*.
4. Judge whether H is confirmed or disconfirmed, contingent on *P* or *~P*.

## Emphasis and Caveats
### Emphasis and Caveats

<!-- - Good theories are akin to an extended syllogism; make your assumptions clear. -->

- Think of theory as like an extended syllogism.
    - Make your assumptions clear.
    - If I accept the assumptions, I accept setting up the theory for an empirical test.
- Falsificationism is key; it's what distinguishes science from non-science.
- Mostly a juxtaposition to inference by induction.
- Even then: there's an inductive component here (the hypothesis evaluation).
- *"Facts" don't speak for themselves.*
    - Notice we said nothing about how we "test *P*".
- *Everything is a model*; all science is necessary simplification.
    - This is true for both theory and method.


# Research Design
### Quantitative Research Design

Basic takeaways:

1. "Concepts" and measures
2. *X*, *Y*, and *Z*
3. Data as spreadsheet

## Concepts and Measures
### Concepts and Measures

The research questions you ask may look something like this:

- How is the U.S. more "powerful" than Russia?
- Why is Europe "richer" than less-developed countries?
- Why is American politics beset with problems of “polarization” and “partisanship?”
- Why have "democracies" never fought a "war" with each other?

These are just examples, and notice I could've put scare quotes too on a few other things (e.g. "less-developed countries").

### Concepts and Measures

*Every discussion about politics you have is conceptual*.

- Concepts are ideas of mental constructs that represent phenomena in the real world.
- Some are simple (e.g. American partisanship). Some are complicated (e.g. corruption).

Concepts intuitively vary among units in the real world.

- Sweden is "richer" than Burundi.
- The U.S. is more “powerful” than Luxembourg.
- Kazakhstan is more “corrupt” than Norway.
- Botswana is more "democratic" than Angola.

### Concepts and Measures

You want **measures** of these concepts.

- e.g. a war is typically measured as any conflict with a 1,000 or more battle-related deaths.

We seek to devise the best measure that best captures the “true” concept.

- However, there’s always some slippage between concept and measure.
- We do our best to eliminate as much error as we can.

### Evaluating Measures

- Systematic and random measurement error
- Validity and reliability

### Systematic Measurement Error

Systematic measurement error is the bigger concern of the two.

- It can confound inference.

This was a big problem in the literature on (American) political tolerance.

- *Concept*: the extent to which individuals express a willingness to "put up with" political attitudes or behavior they find objectionable.
- *Measure*: would you allow a communist or atheist to make a speech in your community/run for office?

	- Individuals that allow this are conceived to be "politically tolerant".
	
### Were Americans Becoming More Tolerant?

![Scenes from the Tenth Communist Party USA convention in Chicago (May 1938)](1938-05-27-communist-party-usa-convention.png)

By the early 1980s, Americans looked to be much more tolerant than they were in the 1950s. Why?

	
### What Was the Problem?

*Answer*: they weren't. Our measure of "political tolerance" was flawed.

- By inserting "least-liked groups", we biased our measure off what we wanted.
- We were measuring ideology, religious values, or variable fear of the USSR in the Cold War, not just "political tolerance".

When we allow individuals to name their least-liked group, Americans are still as politically intolerant as they had ever been.

## X, Y, and Z
### X, Y, and Z

Measures are variables and variables vary.

- We'll discuss levels of measurement in the next lecture.

Generally, our variables of interest are a class of *X*, *Y*, and *Z*.

- *X*: the *independent* variable(s); the "cause" of an effect.
- *Y*: the *dependent* variables(s); the outcome or effect of the cause.
- *Z*: the *control* variables; everything that can mitigate the relationship between *X* and *Y*.


### The Three Types of Relationships Among X, Y, and Z

Spurious

- There is no effect of *X* on *Y*, controlling for *Z*.

Interactive

- The effect of *X* on *Y* depends on the value of *Z*.

Additive

- *X* and *Z* both independently affect *Y*.

### Illustrating These Relationships

Assume this simple set up.

- We are interested in support (*Y*) for some deregulation issue.
- We believe party support (*X*) explains whether a respondent favors or opposes the issue.
- We also want to control for the gender (*Z*) of the respondent.
- We have 24 respondents where we have asked about their party support, policy support, and gender.

Our data look something like this.

###

```{r}
Spurious %>%
  select(-cat) %>%
  group_split(x) -> hold_this

hold_this[[1]] %>%
  bind_cols(., hold_this[[2]]) %>%
  kbl(.,
      col.names = c("Party (X)", "Support (Y)", "Gender (Z)",
                    "Party (X)", "Support (Y)", "Gender (Z)"),
      align = c("cccccc"),
      booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE,linesep = '',
      caption = "A Toy Data Set on Support for Some Policy (Y), by Party Support (X) and Gender (Z) ") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 9) %>%
  footnote(general = "24 total respondents cast across 12 rows for sake of presentation.")
```

### A Spurious Relationship Among X, Y, and Z

We find prima facie support for the effect of *X* on *Y*.

- 41.67% of Left party supporters favor the proposal.
- 58.33% of Right party supporters favor the proposal.

However, there is a major **compositional difference** in the parties, by gender.

- 67% of the Left party are women, compared to 33% of the Right party.

Indeed, this simple example suggests that "controlling" for gender (*Z*) means there's no independent effect of party support (*X*) on support for deregulation (*Y*).

###

```{r}
Spurious %>%
  group_by(x, z) %>%
  count(y) %>%
  mutate(tot = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/tot) %>%
  mutate(x_num = ifelse(x == "L", 0, 1)) %>%
  filter(y == "Favor") %>%
  arrange(x) %>% ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x, perc, color=z, group=z)) +
  theme_steve_web() +
  geom_point() + geom_line(size=1.1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1, by=.1)) +
  labs(x = "Party Support (X)", y = "Percent Supporting the Issue (Y)",
       color = "",
       title = "A Spurious Relationship Between X and Y, Controlling for Z",
       subtitle = "In our simple example, the differences in support are a function of the compositional differences of X by Z.")

```


###

```{r}
Spurious %>%
  group_by(x, z) %>%
  count(y) %>%
  mutate(tot = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/tot) %>%
  mutate(x_num = ifelse(x == "L", 0, 1)) %>%
  filter(y == "Favor") %>%
  arrange(x) %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cat = "Spurious") -> d0

Additive %>%
  group_by(x, z) %>%
  count(y) %>%
  mutate(tot = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/tot) %>%
  mutate(x_num = ifelse(x == "L", 0, 1)) %>%
  filter(y == "Favor") %>%
  arrange(x) %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cat = "Additive") -> d1

Interactive %>%
  group_by(x, z) %>%
  count(y) %>%
  mutate(tot = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(perc = n/tot) %>%
  mutate(x_num = ifelse(x == "L", 0, 1)) %>%
  filter(y == "Favor") %>%
  arrange(x) %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cat = "Interactive") -> d2

bind_rows(d0, d1, d2) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x, perc, color=z, group=z)) +
  theme_steve_web() +
  facet_wrap(~cat) +
  geom_point() + geom_line(size=1.1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,1),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1, by=.1)) +
  labs(x = "Party Support (X)", y = "Percent Supporting the Issue (Y)",
       color = "",
       title = "The Three Types of Controlled Relationships, Visualized",
       subtitle = "If you're arguing for the effect of X on Y, the spurious relationship is the most disappointing to get from an analysis.")

```

### Research Design and Control

Any honest research design needs to "control" for confounding effects of *X* on *Y*.

- It's up to you to determine what exactly is (or are) *Z*.

Experimental designs typically get around this through **random assignment**.

- Everything else requires more work.

## Quantitative Data as Spreadsheet
### Quantitative Data as Spreadsheet

If it helps, think of the "data set" as a spreadsheet.

- Rows: Observations/units of analysis
- Columns: variables across all units

Often you'll get a variable heading (i.e. column name) that is oblique code/label.

- i.e. in the next table, `hinctnta` is an indicator of a respondent's household income, in deciles.
- Put in other words: never lose sight of your codebook.


### An Example Data Set

```{r}
ESS9GB %>%
  select(idno, region, immigsent:lrscale) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kbl(., caption = "A Sample of 10 British Respondents in the European Social Survey (2018)",
      linesep = '', longtable = T, booktabs = T,
      align = c("clcccccc")) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) %>%
  footnote(general = "Data: European Social Survey v. 9 [edition: 1.2]. Interviews done end of 2018/start of 2019.")
```

### What is a Unit of Analysis?

A "unit of analysis" is the type of observation under study. Common types you'll find:

- Individuals (e.g. survey data)
- Individuals over time (common in health studies)
- Geographical units (e.g. counties, regions, sovereign states)
- Geographical units over time (e.g. most economic data you'll find)
- Dyads [over time] (e.g. inter-state conflict data)

Always keep track of your unit of analysis too.

- Beware of the ecological fallacy.


# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Theory, hypothesis, and the scientific enterprise: 

- Communicate your assumptions; acknowledge your perspectives.
- Science is simplification, and falsification.
- Theory *and* method have assumptions we make and accept/reject.
- Most research does not *prove*; you're checking for consistency.

Quantitative research design:

- Everything is a "concept"; you're trying to measure it (well).
- Assessing the effect of *X* on *Y* means controlling for *Z*.
- Think of the data set as just a big ol' spreadsheet.

<!-- ### Hawthorne Effect -->

<!-- The **Hawthorne effect** is related to systematic measurement error. -->

<!-- - It's the phenomenon when individuals change their behavior when they know they're being monitored. -->

<!-- Examples in political science. -->

<!-- - Subjects in non-democratic countries are less likely to disclose true attitudes about the government. -->
<!-- - Americans tell survey researchers they vote when they often do not. -->
<!-- - Western Europeans tend to withhold racist statements to survey researchers. -->
