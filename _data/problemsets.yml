  filename: 3/eh6105-ps3
  description: "The third problem set makes use of some data available in [`{peacesciencer}`](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer) to learn bivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression."

  description: "The fourth problem set makes use of [some simple (American) presidential election data](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/election_turnout.html) in [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata) to learn about simple derivations of the OLS model (e.g. controls, fixed effects)."

Students will also have the option of bootstrapping their regression model here if they want to go hardcore in the last question. Nothing in the course plan said I couldn't have you choose this path if I wanted.  ðŸ˜œ"
